# haCk-LMS (BU-LMS h@cK3d)

### Note: This project is currently being worked upon.Don't rely on it for the time being. Please proceed with caution and HAVE FUN!

#

#### Requirements
- Selenium via  `pip install selenium`
    > It's better if you try and use this with a **virtualenv** 
- Then you need to install [webdriver](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers), according to the web-browser you use
- And you're **Good to GO**

#

#### How to Use
- Create a folder named `completed_assignments` and specify it's directory in the code in the main method in `submission_dir`.
- And create folders with course code and put your assignment inside them with following style:
    > 'Name of assignment to be submitted as seen on LMS'-'Course Detail'
- Then, simply run the script in terminal or any IDE

#

#### Current Features
- Multiple Assignment Submission at once(**BETA**/**BUGGY**/**BROKEN**)

#### Planned Features
- All Files (ppt,pdf,etc..) downloader with course wise folders
- Notifier(not what I'd like to call it): Well to know about all the different submissions one's made and what all he has to submit and also the number of days by which the assignment is overdue/still submittable.

#### Futures
- Creating an app (probably in Flutter) and use it as a daily driver not only on laptops/desktops but also on smart phones

#

## How It Works
Well, what we've done here is basically scraped the HTML file of the [LMS](lms.bennett.edu.in) in the different phases of it's execution.

**The process it follows is similar to that of a human being, meaning the script is trying to immitate human steps of submitting an assignment on the LMS.**
( Imagine yourself doing the same )
